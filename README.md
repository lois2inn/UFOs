# UFOs

## Overview of Project
A data journalist is given an opportunity to write about her hometown: McMinnville, OR. Apart from revisiting memories and people back home, she is excited to record the sightings of UFOs in her hometown and post them online. The project aims to provide interactive visualizations depicting in-depth analysis of UFO sightings using front end technologies like JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Below is the breakdown of tasks achieved in this project: 

- Build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array.
- Create filters to make this table fully dynamic.
- Place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
- Customize the webpage using Bootstrap.
- Equip the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with the visualizations.
  - Allow users to filter data using date.
  - Facilitate users to filter by city, state, country and shape.

## Results

- Describe how someone might use the new webpage by walking through the process of using the search criteria. 
- Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary

- One drawback of this new design
- Two recommendations for further development
